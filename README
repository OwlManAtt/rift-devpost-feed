== Intro ==
This is a simple script to clean up the RiftJunkies dev post tracker. 
It's largely useless due to the volume of moderation/service status posts - I
only want to hear interesting news in my RSS reader.

== Installation ==
Pull the source down and install these gems:

  $ gem install chronic sanitize nokogiri classifier

You may also want to install the Ruby bindings for the GNU GSL library - this
speeds up the bayesian filtering. On Debian systems, the package is called ``libgsl-ruby''.

This script has only been tested on Ruby 1.8.

== Usage == 
clean_feed.rb dumps out current.rss. Stick it in cron and profit.
