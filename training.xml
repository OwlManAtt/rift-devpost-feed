    <text>Hi, All!  
I've seen a few questions floating around about the servers and I wanted to take a few minutes to get you some answers.  Can you make a characters from both factions on the same server?  
Yes. There are no limits on this.  Is that the whole list of servers?  
This is the Head Start list of servers. More servers of various types will be opened as needed. Watch for announcements here and on Twitter and Facebook as we open them.  Can each shard only hold 1500 players?  
I keep seeing references to a dev saying that each sever would only hold 1500 people. The actual quote was from a very old IRC chat where one of our devs was talking about numbers for that current beta as the servers were opened. We do not release specific numbers about our servers. But we saw higher numbers with each beta and the same thing applies to release. The 1500 rumor is false.    </text>
